## Inspiration
I was inspired to create a drawing app that is easy to use whilst being free.

## What it does
It allows user to draw on a canvas and then save it to a .pdf file.

## How I built it
I primarily used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used the application VS Code.

## Challenges we ran into
I ran into problems with how I was implementing the drawing feature. I wanted it to change the transparency, however I had it so it would continuously update and follow mouse and with transparency it would overlay itself and produce a black line. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of getting it to actually work after dealing with hundreds of bugs.

## What we learned
I learned different ways of implementing the drawing, and saving to a pdf format.

## What's next for KISEO: Drawing
I would love to add a few other features like Eraser, Blend, and Blur tools. I have the basics set up but never created the JavaScript for them to actually function.
